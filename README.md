## Getting Started:

This project is a simple demonstration of unit testing in Haskell using the HUnit library. To get started, run the game by entering following command:

```hs
cabal run buzzer
```

Note: The game consists of a buzzer that responds to user input. Your challenge is to understand the logic behind the buzzer without reading the test cases. By running the game and interacting with it, you can explore how the buzzer behaves and try to grasp its underlying mechanism!

## Run test cases:

```hs
cabal test
```
